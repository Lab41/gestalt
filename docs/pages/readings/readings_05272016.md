## ICD3: Towards a 3-Dimensional Model of Individual Cognitive Differences

What impacts a user's performance when interacting with visual analytic 
systems? Typically cognitive factor is not considered or controlled, so 
the team has introduced ICD3 which takes into consideration the three 
cognitive factors. The three cognitive factors are: 

* Cognitive Traits: user characteristics that remain constant
  * perceptual speed
  * spatial ability
  * personality factors (i.e. Five Factor Model & Locus of Control)
* Cognitive States: user characteristics that may change
  * germane load: memory needed to process and understand schemas
  * intrinsic load: memory needed for a given task and 
    cannot be modified by instructional design
  * extraneous load: memokry needed to absorb information and 
    can be modified based on presentation
  * emotional states
* Experience/Bias: learned experience that affects behavior

Limiting the scope of evaluation to any two of the three described
dimensionsn leaves an incomplete and potentially misleading model of 
performance. With ICD3, the visualization system can be adaptive to
the users' analytical needs instead of a one-size-fits-all system 
that is designed today. 

To improve this area of research, we should be able to:

* record as many cognitive factorsas posssible, in as little time as 
  possible with as little diruption as possible
* find the dominant individual cognitive factors both within dimensions
  and between dimensions in order to limit the number of cognitive tests

### Our Discussion

We were left confused as to how to implement the ICD3 model as the paper
goes into the theory of ICD3 and not the implementation of ICD3. 

We will look into capturing user's analytics with little disruption like
the authors have suggested. 

The following are interesting tidbits of information learned in the paper:

* positive emotional states enhance visuospatial working memory
* introverts tend to perform well when given positive feedback and worse
  when given negative feedback. The opposite is true for extraverts
* those who have external locus of control (those who feel controlled by)
  perform better in visualization where they have had no previous experience
  compare to those who have internal locus of control (those who feel in 
  control of)
