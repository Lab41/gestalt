Unlike User Schema where the schema categorizes each individual, Story Schema goes in order, and the information from the previous order will drive the next order.

{% include callout.html content="1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5" type="primary" %}

## 1: Qualitative vs Quantitative
* Is the information **conceptual (qualitative)** or **data driven (quantitative)**?

It is uncertain whether this step is necessary because the presumption is all of our data is quantitative and not qualitative.

## 2: Main Idea

* What is the **main idea** ?
* What is the beginning, middle, and end? 
* What is the setting, the main character, the imbalance, the balance, and the solution?

## 3: Emphasis

* What do you want to **emphasize**?

## 4: Visualize

* What would you like to **visualize**?


There are five (or more) different ways to visualize:
 
* comparison
* relationship
* network
* distribution
* composition

## 5: Visual Display

* What is the visual display?

### Comparison

* *simple text*: for one or two data points
* *table*: for verbal communication (unlike graph)
* *heat map*: for visualizing relative magnitude of numbers, please use one shade of color and display its respective legend
* *graph*: for visual communication (unlike table)
  * *line graph*: for continuous data 
  * *slope graph*: for comparing two time periods or points of interest
* *vertical/horizontal bar chart* (horizontal is better)
* *circular area chart*: for cyclical data 

### Relationship
* *scatterplot*: for relationship between two things
* *scatterplot bubble size*
* *CPR*: correlation between two attributes
* *snowflake*: correlation between multiple attributes

### Network
* *flow chart*
* *map of geography*
* *hierarchies*
* *2x2*
* *networks*

### Distribution
* *histogram* 
  * *vertical bar histogram*
  * *line histogram*
* *scatterplot*: for two or more variables
* *alluvials*
* *sankey*

### Composition
* *waterfall*: for showing a starting and ending point or for pulling apart stacked bar chart
* *stacked bar chart*
  * *vertical stacked bar chart*: for comparing subcomponents, it is important when comparing a subcomponent that this compared subcomponent is reordered to be the bottom. 
  * *horizontal stacked bar chart*: for comparing negative to positive subcomponents
* *square area*: for comparing numbers of vastly different magnitudes
