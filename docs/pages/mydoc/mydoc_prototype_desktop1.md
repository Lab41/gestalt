## Overview

This prototype uses a webpy RESTful API backend and an Angular 1.0 frontend. Currently this is an empty shell. Data visualization stories will be developed inside this application framework.

The updated prototype will use Django backend and Angular 1.0 frontend. You can check its progress in a separate [repo](https://github.com/tiffanyj41/adp) from Gestalt.
