Currently, we categorize users to four different types. We have not yet discovered whether or not there is additional hierarchy within the User Schema.
 
## Management 
**Visual Persuasion**: Management would like to know why this data is important to them. 

## Subject Matter Expert (SME)
**Visual Confirmation**: SME would like to confirm (or disaffirm) what they already know about the data. Accuracy is important for this user.

## Peer of SME 
**Visual Understanding**: A peer of SME who does not have the context of the data but understand the field would like to understand what the data is about.

## Generalist 
**Big Picture**: Generalist would also like to understand what the data is about but with less detail than a Peer of SME would.
