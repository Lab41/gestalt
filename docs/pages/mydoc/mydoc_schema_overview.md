The goal of Gestalt is to tell a visual story, and it depends on:

* the **datasets** that we are using
* the **user** who we are telling the story
* the types of **story** that we are trying to tell
* the types of **medium** that we use to tell the story

To accomplish this goal, we break each of these components further
into their respective parts, or what we like to call them as "schema."
For example, User Schema consists of users who have general knowledge
of the data and users who have in-depth knowledge of the data. If we wanted
to paint a comparison story, the story that we tell for the first set of
users will be different than the story that we tell for the second set 
of users. We will also tell the story differently depending on the 
dataset that we have, the type of story that we want to tell (in this
case we are telling the users a comparison story), and the type of medium
that we want to use to tell the story. Piecing together all four schemas
will help us build a visual story that is fitting to the user. 

In short, Gestalt consists of four schemas:

* **raw schema**: the components that differentiate one **dataset** from the next
* **user schema**: the components that make up the different types of **users**
* **story schema**: the types of **story** that we are trying to tell
* **ui schema**: the UI components needed to tell the story on a particular **medium**
