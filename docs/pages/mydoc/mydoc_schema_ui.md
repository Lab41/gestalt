UI Schema breaks down the UI components that are needed to tell the story on a particular medium.

* A **story** is the smallest component of a UI.
* A **panel** is composed of multiple stories.
* A **workspace** is composed of multiple panels.

Therefore, it can be summarized as:
{% include callout.html content="Workspace <- Panel <- Story" type="primary" %}

Our current goal is to tell the visual story to the user using the following mediums:

* desktop
* tablet

{% include links.html %}
