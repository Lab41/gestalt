We understand the importance of structuring the database. For this reason, 
we are happy to bring you the script to build the database's tables. These 
tables contain the data necessary for the layout of the UI. You can view 
them under `gestalt/external/database`. 

In the future, we would like to script the entire setup because we want it 
to be  an install-and-play for those who are interested. But for now, please 
enjoy the script to build the database's tables.

Also, we have improved the backend for the desktop prototype. It extracts
the data from the PostgreSQL database.
