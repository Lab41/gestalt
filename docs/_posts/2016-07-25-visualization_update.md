Gestalt is in the process of building multiple different visualizations
for the contagion dataset. For those of you who are not familiar with 
what a contagion dataset represents, think of the game Pandemic and 
the likelihood of a certain event occuring based on a previous event.

We will approach this in a variety of ways. In a contagion dataset, you 
want to determine the **high degree nodes** (or the nodes with the highest
number of connections). The reason why we want to know the high degree
node is because it has the highest influence to be contagious. We will 
visualize this via a *tile grid map* and a *horizontal bar graph*.

Another aspect that we would like to extract from a contagion dataset
is **directionality**. We will visualize this via a *line graph*.

Lastly, what are the probability that a particular node will be 
affected by the contagion? We will visualize **contingent probability
of a crisis** using the *lollipop graph*.

We hope you look forward to our future updates as much as we do. 
We really can't wait to see the result!
