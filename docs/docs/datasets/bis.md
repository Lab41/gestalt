The BIS dataset that we use is the [consolidated banking statistics](http://www.bis.org/statistics/full_bis_cbs_csv.zip), 
which provides data on cross-border bilateral banking ownership ties. 

We then sort just the rows for:

* Quarterly 
* Amounts Outstanding/Stocks
* Domestic Banks (4B, excluding domestic claims)
* CBS counterpartly basis: Immediate counterparty basis
* Total Claims
* All Instruments
* All Maturities
* All Currencies
* All Sectors
