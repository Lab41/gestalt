## Our Goal

[Lab41](https://www.lab41.org) embarks on an open source project called Gestalt.
Its goal is to tell a visual story from big data.

We will employ various data visualization tools and user experience frameworks 
to construct cohesive data stories focused on communicating ripple-effect 
scenarios. Several event-based datasets from different disciplines will serve 
as the basis for data story development. Lab41 will develop an optimal front-end 
visualization development stack in which user experience is a driver. Our 
ultimate goal is to create a roadmap for how to approach visual data stories 
from technical considerations to user engagement.

## Products

We will develop two prototypes: one for the [desktop](mydoc_prototype_desktop1.html) 
and one for the [tablet](mydoc_prototype_tablet1.html). Please checkout our 
[quick start page](mydoc_quickstart.html) to start running the prototypes locally on
your computer.
